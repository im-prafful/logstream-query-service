# LogStream - Query Service üîç

A NestJS microservice that provides a secure and efficient API for querying and retrieving structured log data from the database.

This service acts as the backend-for-frontend (BFF), serving all data required by the LogStream dashboard. It exposes endpoints for searching, filtering, and aggregating log data, ensuring the frontend remains decoupled from the underlying database schema.
